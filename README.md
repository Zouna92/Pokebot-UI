# Pokebot-UI
Hey everyone. I've been working on a simple UI design for the Poke Mob Bot / Necrobot. It has the ability to let you choose between several bot settings.

Currently you can switch between EXP- noSniping mode. EXP- nestSniping, single snipe, auto snipe and Farmpokeballs.

EXP-noSniping
This is the best EXP source. You will level up at a rate of 100k-180k EXP/h. As the name suggests it will not snipe Pokemon on certain locations

EXP-nestSnipe
This can be better than EXP-noSnipe, however you will spam catch alot of pokemon in the nests. Do this when you have alot of Pokeballs left. You can change the locations/pokemon in Nest Config.

Single Snipe
You can enter a Name and a location on the bottom of the bot to snipe one single pokemon on the world.

Auto snipe
You will start sniping all rare pokemons provided from pokesnipers.com

Farmpokeballs
This will stop catching pokemon and start gathering Pokeballs.

I'm still working on this and I will update more features and settings in the future. 
Enjoy botting!
